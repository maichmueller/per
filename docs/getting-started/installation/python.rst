Python package
==============

The installation of PER as the python package per is straightforward via pip, i.e.::

    pip install per

If one wants to install the library locally, then download the repository to a directory of your choice e.g. via::

    git clone https://github.com/maichmueller/per.git

change into the directory `cd per` and call::

    pip install .

This will automatically compile the python extension and install it into your environment. I recommend using a conda
environment.
